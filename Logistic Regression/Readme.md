## Generalized Linear Models
I have built logistic regression models using all parameters, reduced parameter and single best parameter.

__Installations:__ Required packages will be installed automatically in the script.

__Method:__ Grouping of column values is explained in the attached PDF.
In case seed value is changed, the grouping should be changes as pivot tables generated would be different.

- The eBayAuctions.xls file must be in the same directory as the R Script.
- Excel containg pivot tables, coefficients is added in the folder as well.
- In case the seed value is changed, it will result in a different train-test split. In this case, the grouping of attribute values must be changed.
